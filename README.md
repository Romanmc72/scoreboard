# Scoreboard

Hate ripping up a bunch of pieces of paper to try and keep track of analog game scores? Do you not trust your math skills or the math skills of your friends to correctly add points together? Fear no longer! Now we have a digital scoreboard which will track it all for you <3!

## Using this

Probably an `./up.sh` and a `./down.sh` script will be all we need here after installing the `requirements.txt`.

### Always remember

Have fun! And if you're not first, you're last.
